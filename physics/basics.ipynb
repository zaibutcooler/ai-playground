    "1st Law: Objects stay still or keep moving at a steady speed unless something pushes or pulls them.\r\n",
    "2nd Law: The harder you push an object, the faster it accelerates. Also, heavier objects need more force to move.\r\n",
    "3rd Law: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. When you push against something, it pushes back with the sam##  pull.\n",
