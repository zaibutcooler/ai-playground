Express h and the base b of the isosceles triangle shown in terms of θ and r.
Solution
As we can see in the second picture, height (h) divides the angle θ and the base (b) into half. Each half of the angle θ with a value of angle θ /2 and both parts of teh base have a b/2 value.

Using this information, we can find values for h and b,

h= r cos(θ/2)

b/2 = r sin(θ/2)
b = 2r sin(θ/2)

Express the area of the isosceles triangle in terms of θ and r. Use trig identities as needed.
Solution
The formula for the area of a triangle is
A = 1/2 bh

If we input the values of base and height,

A = 1/2 (r cos θ/2) (2r sin(θ/2))

A = r^2 cosθ/2 sinθ/2

A = 1/2 r^2 sinθ

Describe what happens as n goes to infinity, (notice the polygon fills the circle, the angle θ goes to zero)
Solution
As the number of the sides n goes to infinity, the angle θ becomes 0, the inscribed polygon becomes smoother and turn into a circle.

Use special limit rules to discuss your response, you may use any graphing tool to support your response.
Solution
To properly show that indeed becomes a circle, let us get the limit of the area. The area of the whole polygon is the area of the triangle multiplied to n.

Aploygon = n \* 1/2 r^2 sin θ

Now, we express θ as a function of n

Recall : θ = \( \pi \) / \( \pi \)
