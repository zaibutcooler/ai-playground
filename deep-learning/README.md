1. An airplane is flying towards a radar station at a constant height of 6 km above the ground. If the distance s between the airplane and the radar station is decreasing at a rate of 400 km per hour when s=10 km., what is the horizontal speed of the plane? Make sure your answer includes units.

Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t
dv/dt = -400/t

Substitute s = 10 and dv/dt = -400 to solve for t
Time (t) = 1 hours

Solve for the horizontal speed v when s = 10
Horizontal speed (v) = 10 km/h

2. A boat is being pulled into a dock by a rope attached to it and passing through a pulley on the deck, positioned 6 meters higher than the boat. If the rope is being pulled in at a rate of 3 meters/sec, how fast is the boat approaching the dock when it is 8 meters from the dock? Make sure your answer includes units.

Equation relating x, y, and d using the Pythagorean theorem:
-d^2 + x^2 + y\*\*2 = 0

Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:
d/dt[ -d^2 + x^2 + y^2 ] = 0

Substitute y = d and d = 6 into the equation:
0 = 0

Solve for dx/dt:
dx/dt = 0

Substitute x = 8 into dx/dt to find the rate of change of x when x = 8:
dx/dt = 0 m/s

3. A girl is flying a kite on a string. The kite is 120 ft. above the ground and the wind is blowing the kite horizontally away from her at 6 ft/sec. At what rate must she let out the string when 130 ft of string has been released? Make sure your answer includes units.

Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t:
dv/dt = -400/t

Substitute s = 10 and dv/dt = -400 to solve for t:
Time (t) = 1/3600 hours

Solve for the horizontal speed v when s = 10:
Horizontal speed (v) = 1439.54992966552\*I km/h
